Creating Sales and Service Dashboards with IBM Cognos Analytics & Looker
📝 Overview
This project focuses on developing data-driven dashboards to provide a regional manager of a car dealership with actionable insights into sales and service department performance. Leveraging IBM Cognos Analytics and Looker Studio, the goal is to create intuitive visualizations that enable better decision-making and operational efficiency.

🔧 Software Used:
IBM Cognos Analytics (Trial Version)
Looker (Trial Version)
📊 Dataset Used:
The dataset is sourced from the IBM Accelerator Catalog, with modifications made for this assignment. It includes automotive industry data, focusing on key metrics such as car sales, customer sentiment, recalls, and dealer profit.

🚗 Assignment Scenario:
As a regional manager for a chain of car dealerships, the task was to create two dashboards:

Sales Dashboard: A tabbed template dashboard displaying KPIs related to sales performance, including profit, quantity sold, and profit by dealer.
Service Dashboard: A 2x2 rectangle template dashboard with visualizations related to car recalls, customer sentiment, and car sales vs. profit.
📈 Key Visualizations and KPIs:
Sales Dashboard:

Profit (in millions of US dollars) 💵
Quantity sold 📦
Quantity sold by model (bar chart) 📊
Average quantity sold 📏
Profit by dealer ID (column chart) 📊
Service Dashboard:

Recalls per model (column chart) 🚗
Customer sentiment (treemap) 🧠
Quantity of cars sold per month vs. profit (line and column chart) 📅💰
Recalls by model and affected system (heatmap) 🔥
🔍 Looker Dashboard Implementation:
In addition to IBM Cognos Analytics, this project also explores Looker. The dashboards were replicated in Looker with the following steps:

Loaded the automotive dataset into Looker 🗃️
Used LookML to model the data and create visualizations 🧩
Created two dashboards: one for Sales KPIs and one for Service Metrics 📊
Created interactive and dynamic reports with Looker 📋
Key visualizations, including bar charts, treemaps, and heatmaps, were created in Looker to reflect the required KPIs.

💾 Export and Submission:
Once the dashboards were completed in both Cognos Analytics and Looker, they were exported as PDFs for grading and submission 📄. If export failed, screenshots of the dashboards were also submitted 📸.

📂 Folder Structure:
/Cognos Dashboards: Contains exported PDF versions of the Cognos dashboards 📑.
/Looker Dashboards: Contains Looker dashboard exports 📊.
